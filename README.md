# VoxelPathTracer
A real-time Voxel Path Tracer created with Cuda and OpenGL.

This engine was created as a fun hobby experiment and not to be a serious production-ready engine. As a consequence of this merely being a fun experiment, I didn't really care about writing organised or clean code. I have never refactored the code even once and let me tell you, it shows!

So just keep the intent here in mind before getting too mad at my poor code's awfulness.
